     <h1>Welcome to the Wonderland</h1>
     <h2><u>TICKETS & PASSES</u></h2>
     <p>Wonderland, the surreal and whimsical setting of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll, is a place
          where conventional geography and logic are turned upside down. Alice enters this bizarre world through a
          rabbit hole, leading her to a hall of doors, each offering passage to different, unpredictable parts of
          Wonderland. This dreamlike landscape includes a beautiful but initially inaccessible garden, a pool formed by
          Alice's own tears, and a magical mushroom with the power to alter her size. The geography further unravels
          with scenes like the Mad Hatter's perpetual tea party, set at an endlessly long table outdoors, and the Queen
          of Heartsâ€™ croquet ground, where flamingos serve as mallets and hedgehogs as balls. The courtroom, where Alice
          witnesses an absurd trial, encapsulates the chaotic and arbitrary nature of Wonderland. Throughout her
          journey, Alice navigates a constantly shifting environment that mirrors her inner experiences, emphasizing
          themes of transformation, disorientation, and the challenges of growing up in a world where nothing is as it
          seems.</p>
